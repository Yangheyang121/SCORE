Beta version implementing a right-handed coordinate system with
x || RD, y || TD, z || ND and utilizing the deGraef quaternion library, 
such that mutual consistency with DAMASK is obtained


Simulation run01-run07 were executed on MAWS15 using the executable SCORESourceCodeTopLevelMAWS15.tar.gz
Simulation run08-run14 were executed on MAWS16 using the executable SCORESourceCodeMAWS16.tar.gz
Both series of simulations constitute parameter test studies and preliminary results
The results from run01 were used for the MMM2018 poster from Martin

Simulation run16-run18 are the last ones and were used for the paper in MSMSE2019
